Version: 1.2.3a19 (unreleased)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWS and CHANGES:

  - Running (and model):

    * NEW: Support scenario file locations on command-line, ala: "{filename}:{line}" (related to: #160).
    * Formatters are now created only once (was: once for each feature).
    * Scenarios can be now be selected by name or regular expression (#87).
    * Dry-run mode: Detects now undefined steps.
    * Dry-run mode: Uses untested counts now (was using: skipped counts).
    * Run decision logic: Use ModelElement.mark_skipped() to preselect what not to run.
    * Run decision logic: Use ModelElement.should_run() to decide if element should run.

  - Parsing (and model):

    * Parser: Add support for Scenario/ScenarioOutline descriptions (related to: #79).
    * Parser: Refactor to simplify and avoid code duplications (related to: #79).
    * Parser: Improve diagnostics when parse errors occur.
    * Parser: Check that Backgrounds have no tags.
    * NEW: json_parser, parses JSON output and builds model.
    * json_parser: Add support for scenario descriptions (related to: #79).

  - Formatters:

    * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
      Formatter Ctor uses now StreamOpener instead of opened Stream.
      Formatter output streams are now opened late, under control of the formatter.
      This allows the formatter to support also directory mode (if needed).
      Needed for RerunFormatter whose file was overwritten before it was read (#160).

    * NEW: RerunFormatter to simplify to rerun last failing scenarios (related to: #160).
    * NEW: TagLocationFormatter, shows where tags are used.
    * NEW: TagCountFormatter, shows which tags are used and how often (reborn).

    * JSONFormatter: Added "type" to Background, Scenario, ScenerioOutline (related to: #161).
    * JSONFormatter: Added "error_message" to result (related to: #161).
    * JSONFormatter: Use now list<lines> instead of string for multi-line text (related to: #161).
    * JSONFormatter: Add support for scenario descriptions (related to: #79).
    * JSONFormatter: Generates now valid JSON (well-formed).
    * PlainFormatter: Shows now multi-line step parts (text, table), too.
    * PrettyFormatter: Enters now monochrome mode if output is piped/redirected.
    * ProgressFormatter: Flushes now output to provide better feedback.

  - Reporters:

    * JUnitReporter: Show complete scenario w/ text/tables. Improve readability.
    * SummaryReporter: Summary shows now untested items if one or more exist.

  - Testing, development:
