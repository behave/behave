Feature: Use Alternate Step Implementations for Each Test Stage

  As I tester and test writer
  I want to run the same feature with other step implementations during different testing stages
  So I can run quick checks in a development environment and detailed checks in a testlab.

  . CONCEPT: TEST STAGE
  .   A test stage allows you to use different step/environment implementations
  .   compared to other test stage or the default, unnamed test stage.
  .
  .   Examples for test stages are:
  .     * develop (using the development environment with more diagnostics)
  .     * product (using the product database, ...)
  .     * systemtest
  .     * systemint (system integration)
  .     * ...
  .
  .   NOTE:
  .   Test stages can be used to adapt to different test environments
  .   while using these test stages.
  .
  .
  . EXAMPLE DIRECTORY LAYOUT (with default stage and stage=testlab):
  .
  .   features/
  .       +-- steps/                # -- Step implementations for default stage.
  .       |   +-- foo_steps.py
  .       +-- testlab_steps/        # -- Step implementations for stage=testlab.
  .       |   +-- foo_steps.py
  .       +-- *.feature
  .       +-- environment.py          # -- Environment for default stage.
  .       +-- testlab_environment.py  # -- Environment for stage=testlab.
