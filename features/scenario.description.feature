Feature: Scenario Description

    As a tester
    I want to explain the rationale of a test scenario or scenario outline
    Before I actually execute the steps.

    | SPECIFICATION: Scenario Description
    |   * Scenario descriptions are in optional section between
    |     Scenario line and the first step.
    |   * All description lines are added to the scenario description.
    |   * Empty lines are not part of the scenario description (are removed).
    |   * Comment lines are not part of the scenario description (are removed).
    |   * A Scenario/ScenarioOutline with a scenario description,
    |     but without steps is valid (to support preparation of scenarios).
    |
    | SPECIFICATION: A scenario description line...
    |   * must not start with step keywords, like:
    |
    |       Given, When, Then, And, But, etc.
    |       (including lower-case versions)
    |
    |   * must not start with '*' (ASTERISK) due to basic step keyword ambiguity
    |   * must not start with '@' (AT) due to tag ambiguity
    |     (supporting: scenario without steps but with step description).
    |   * may start with '|' (table-cell-separator).
    |   * does not contain only whitespace chars (empty line, filtered-out).
    |   * does not start with '#' (HASH) after whitespace chars (comment line).
