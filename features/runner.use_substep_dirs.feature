Feature: Use substep directories

  As a behave user
  I want to use a deep, hierarchical steps dir,
  meaning steps from subdirs of the steps directory,
  So that the steps directory structure is more cleaned up.

  . HINT:
  .   If you really have so many step modules,
  .   better use step-libraries, instead (in many cases).
  .
  . REQUIRES: path.py

  Background:

    And a file named "features/steps/use_substep_dirs.py" with:

      SUBSTEP_DIRS = list(HERE.walkdirs())
