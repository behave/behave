Feature: Rerun Formatter

    To simplify to run the scenarios that have failed during the last test run
    As a tester
    I want that behave generates the necessary information for me.

    | SOLUTION:
    |
    |   Put RerunFormatter into "behave.ini" configuration file:
    |
    |       # -- file:behave.ini
    |       [behave]
    |       format   = rerun
    |       outfiles = rerun.txt
    |
    |   Then a "rerun.txt" file is generated during each test run
    |   that contains the file locations of the failing scenarios, like:
    |
    |       # -- file:rerun.txt
    |       # RERUN: Failing scenarios during last test run.
    |       features/alice.feature:10
    |       features/alice.feature:42
    |
    |   To rerun the failing scenarios of the last test run, use:
    |
    |       behave @rerun.txt
