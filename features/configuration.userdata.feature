Feature: Define custom settings to be used by step definitions

  As a tester
  I want to pass custom settings from outside behave to the step definitions
  So I can control resource usage and management of steps without changing code

  Background:
    Given a new working directory
      And a file named "features/file.feature" with:
          """
          Feature:
            Scenario:
              When a file is created as a result of a step
              Then it is cleaned up after the scenario unless told otherwise
          """
      And a file named "features/steps/file.py" with:

    Scenario: Passing custom settings through the command line
