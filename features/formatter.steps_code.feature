Feature: StepWithCode Formatter

  As a tester
  I want to know which python code is executed
  when I run my scenario steps in a Gherkin file (aka: Feature file)
  So that I can better understand how everything fits together
  And that I can inspected the step-definition source code parts

  NOTE: Primarily intended for dry-run mode.
