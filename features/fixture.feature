Feature: Fixture

  As a BDD writer
  I want to be able to use fixtures (scope guard)
  So that it is easy to provide setup/cleanup functionality.

  . SPECIFICATION:
  .   A fixture provides common test-support functionality.
  .   It contains the setup functionality and in many cases a teardown/cleanup part.
  .   To simplify writing fixtures, setup and cleanup part are in the same function
  .   (same as: @contextlib.contextmanager, @pytest.fixture).
  .
  .   In most case, you want to use a fixture-tag in a "*.feature" file (in Gherkin)
  .   to mark that a scenario or feature should use a specific fixture.
  .
  .   EXAMPLE:
  .
  .     # -- FILE: features/environment.py
  .     @fixture
  .     def fixture_foo(ctx, *args, **kwargs):  # -- CASE: generator-function
  .         the_fixture = setup_fixture_foo(*args, **kwargs)
  .         ctx.foo = the_fixture
  .         yield the_fixture
  .         cleanup_fixture_foo(the_fixture)   # -- SKIPPED: On fixture-setup-error
  .
  .     @fixture(name="fixture.bar")
  .     def fixture_bar(ctx, *args, **kwargs):  # -- CASE: function
  .         the_fixture = setup_fixture_bar(*args, **kwargs)
  .         ctx.bar = the_fixture
  .         ctx.add_cleanup(the_fixture.cleanup)
  .         return the_fixture
  .
  .     # -- ENVIRONMENT-HOOKS:
  .     def before_tag(ctx, tag):
  .         if tag == "fixture.foo":
  .             # -- NOTE: Calls setup_fixture part (until yield statement) and
  .             #    registers cleanup_fixture which will be called when
  .             #    context scope is left (after scenario, feature or test-run).
  .             the_fixture = use_fixture(fixture_foo, ctx)
