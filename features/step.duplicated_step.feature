Feature: Duplicated Step Definitions

  As I tester and test writer
  I want to know when step definitions are duplicated
  So that I can fix these problems.


  Scenario: Duplicated Step in same File
    Given a new working directory
    And a file named "features/steps/alice_steps.py" with:
      """
      from behave import given, when, then

      @given(u'I call Alice')
      def step(context):
          pass

      """
    When I run "behave -f plain features/duplicated_step_alice.feature"
    Then it should fail
    And the command output should contain:

        existing step @given('I call Alice') at features/steps/alice_steps.py:3
