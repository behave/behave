Feature: Step Dialect for Basics Steps

  In order to execute a sequence of steps without BDD keywords (Given/When/Then)
  As a test/story writer
  I want to have the possibility to express myself.

  | SPECIFICATION: Basic step
  |   * Prefix each step with a '*' (asterisk) character to mark it as step
  |   * Provide step-functions/step definition with "@step" decorator
