Feature: Advanced, more complex directory layout (Variant 2)

  As a story/test writer
  I want a deeper, more structured directory structure when many feature files exist
  So that I have the parts better under control (more managable)

  | ADVANCED, MORE COMPLEX DIRECTORY LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
  |     features/
  |       +-- group1.features/
  |       |      +-- *.feature
  |       +-- group2.features/
  |       |      +-- *.feature
  |       +-- steps/*.py          # Step definitions or step-library imports.
  |       +-- environment.py      # OPTIONAL: environment setup/hooks.
