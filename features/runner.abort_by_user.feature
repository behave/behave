Feature: Test run can be aborted by the user

  As a tester
  I want sometimes to abort a test run (because it is anyway failing, etc.)
  So that I am more productive.

  | NOTES:
  |  * The test runner should fail gracefully (most of the times)
  |  * At least some cleanup hooks should be called (in general)
