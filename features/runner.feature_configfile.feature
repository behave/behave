Feature: Feature-Configfile (List of feature filenames/directories)

    As a tester
    I want to run a list of features together
    And I do not want to provide the list each time
    But provide a text file that contains the list of features.

    | SPECIFICATION: behave file args
    |  * Prepend an '@' char (AT) to the feature configfile name to classify it.
    |
    | SPECIFICATION: Feature configfile (text file)
    |  * Each line contains a feature filename or directory with features
    |  * Feature filenames/dirnames are relative to the feature configfile
    |  * Empty lines are removed while reading
    |  * Comment lines are removed while reading (start with '#' char)
    |
    | SPECIFICATION: Runner
    |  * Feature configfile with unknown/not found feature files
    |    cause runner to fail.
    |
    | NOTE: Also supported by Cucumber.

    |  * issue #75
