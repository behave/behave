Feature: Undefined Step

    | Terminology:
    |  * An undefined step is a step without matching step implementation.
    |
    | Specification:
    |  * An undefined step should be reported after the run.
    |  * An undefined step should cause its scenario to fail.
    |  * If an undefined step is detected the remaining scenario steps are skipped.
    |  * All undefined steps in a scenario should be reported (issue #42).
    |  * Undefined steps should be detected even after a step fails in a scenario.
    |  * Each undefined step should be reported only once.
    |  * If a scenario is disabled (by tag expression, etc.),
    |    the undefined step discovery should not occur.
    |    This allows to prepare scenarios that are not intended to run (yet).
    |  * Option --dry-run should discover undefined steps, too.
    |
    | RELATED TO:
    |  * issue #42  Multiple undefined steps in same scenario are detected.
