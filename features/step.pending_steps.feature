Feature: Pending Step (Step exists with StepNotImplementedError Marker)

   . TERMINOLOGY:
   .  * A pending step exists and is registered in the step-registry.
   .  * BUT: step-function is not implemented yet (StepNotImplementedError)
   .
   . SPECIFICATION:
   .  * A pending step exists and is registered in the step-registry.
   .  * Therefore, a binding exists between the step-pattern and step-function.
   .  * A pending step raises a StepNotImplemented exception.
   .  * A pending step is passed if its scenario has a @wip tag.
   .  * A pending step is passed if its scenario inherits a @wip tag.
   .  * A pending step fails with error otherwise.
   .  * Pending steps are not detected in dry-run mode
   .    (because the step-function is not executed)
   .
   . EXCEPTION(s) FOR PENDING STEPS:
   .  * StepNotImplementedError
   .  * PendingStepError (alternative; derived from: StepNotImplementedError)
   .
   . RELATED: Undefined steps
   .  * An undefined step is not found in the step-registry.
   .  * Therefore, no binding exists between step-pattern and step-function.
   .

   .  * step.undefined_steps.feature
