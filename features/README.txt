behave features: Self-Tests
===============================================================================

This directory contains feature tests that are executed with behave.
These self-tests are used to:

  * ensure that ``behave`` reacts as expected
  * define the common expected behaviour for behave
  * support "Acceptance Test Driven-Design" (ATDD)
