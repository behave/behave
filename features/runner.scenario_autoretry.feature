Feature: Auto-retry failed scenarios (a number of times)

  As a tester in an unreliable environment
  I want that failed scenarios are automatically retried a number of times
  So that these scenarios are passing

  NOTE:
  This problem should occur rather seldom, but may occur when the server or
  network infrastructure, etc. is unreliable and causes random failures.
