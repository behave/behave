Feature: Fixture that uses an Async-Resource

  As a BDD writer
  I want to use a fixture that uses an Async-Resource
  So that I can better use/setup/teardown async/asyncio-based functionality.

  . SEE: Async Fixtures -- https://github.com/behave/behave/issues/1211
  . RELATED: features/fixture.feature
  . RELATED TO: asyncio.Runner (since: Python 3.11)
  .   * Use "backports.asyncio.runner" for older Python versions.
  .   * SEE: https://pypi.org/project/backports.asyncio.runner

  Background: Feature Setup

    And an empty file named "example4me/__init__.py"
