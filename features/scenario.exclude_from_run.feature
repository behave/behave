Feature: Exclude Scenario from Test Run

    As a test writer
    I want sometimes to decide at runtime
    that a scenario is excluded from a test run
    So that the command-line configuration becomes simpler
    (and auto-configuration is supported).

    . MECHANISM:
    .   The "before_scenario()" hook can decide just before a scenario should run
    .   that the scenario should be excluded from the test-run.
    .   NOTE: Hooks are not called in dry-run mode.
    .
    . RATIONALE:
    .   There are certain situations where it is better to skip a scenario
    .   than to run and fail the scenario.
    .
    .   Reasons for these cases are of often test environment related:
    .     * test environment does not fulfill the desired criteria
    .     * used testbed does not fulfill test requirements
    .
    .   Instead of providing the exclude-scenario selection on the command-line,
    .   the test (environment) and configuration logic should determine
    .   if a test should be excluded (as auto-configuration functionality).
    .
    . EXAMPLE:
    .   Certain scenarios should not run on Windows (or Linux, ...).
    .
    . EVALUATION ORDER:
    .   Before the user can exclude a scenario from a test-run,
    .   additional mechanisms decide, if the scenario is part of the selected run-set.
    .   These are:
    .     * tags
    .     * ...
    .
