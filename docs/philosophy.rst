Behavior Driven Development
===========================

Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development
technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and
non-technical or business participants in a software project. It was
originally named in 2003 by `Dan North`__ as a response to test-driven
development (TDD), including acceptance test or customer test driven
development practices as found in extreme programming. It has `evolved over
the last few years`__.

On the "Agile specifications, BDD and Testing eXchange" in November 2009 in
London, Dan North `gave the following definition of BDD`__:

  BDD is a second-generation, outside–in, pull-based, multiple-stakeholder,
  multiple-scale, high-automation, agile methodology. It describes a cycle
  of interactions with well-defined outputs, resulting in the delivery of
  working, tested software that matters.

BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software behavior
through discussion with stakeholders. It extends TDD by writing test cases
in a natural language that non-programmers can read. Behavior-driven
developers use their native language in combination with the ubiquitous
language of domain-driven design to describe the purpose and benefit of
their code. This allows the developers to focus on why the code should be
created, rather than the technical details, and minimizes translation
between the technical language in which the code is written and the domain
language spoken by the business, users, stakeholders, project management,
etc.


BDD practices
-------------

The practices of BDD include:

- Establishing the goals of different stakeholders required for a vision to
  be implemented
- Drawing out features which will achieve those goals using feature
  injection
- Involving stakeholders in the implementation process through outside–in
  software development
- Using examples to describe the behavior of the application, or of units
  of code
- Automating those examples to provide quick feedback and regression
  testing
- Using 'should' when describing the behavior of software to help clarify
  responsibility and allow the software's functionality to be questioned
- Using 'ensure' when describing responsibilities of software to
  differentiate outcomes in the scope of the code in question from
  side-effects of other elements of code.
- Using mocks to stand-in for collaborating modules of code which have not
  yet been written


Outside–in
----------

BDD is driven by `business value`__; that is, the benefit to the business
which accrues once the application is in production. The only way in which
this benefit can be realized is through the user interface(s) to the
application, usually (but not always) a GUI.

In the same way, each piece of code, starting with the UI, can be
considered a stakeholder of the other modules of code which it uses. Each
element of code provides some aspect of behavior which, in collaboration
with the other elements, provides the application behavior.

The first piece of production code that BDD developers implement is the UI.
Developers can then benefit from quick feedback as to whether the UI looks
and behaves appropriately. Through code, and using principles of good
design and refactoring, developers discover collaborators of the UI, and of
every unit of code thereafter. This helps them adhere to the principle of
YAGNI, since each piece of production code is required either by the
business, or by another piece of code already written.


The Gherkin language
--------------------

The requirements of a retail application might be, "Refunded or exchanged
items should be returned to stock." In BDD, a developer or QA engineer
might clarify the requirements by breaking this down into specific
examples. The language of the examples below is called Gherkin and is used
by *behave* as well as many other tools.

.. code-block:: gherkin

 Scenario: Refunded items should be returned to stock
   Given a customer previously bought a black sweater from me
     and I currently have three black sweaters left in stock.
    When he returns the sweater for a refund
    then I should have four black sweaters in stock.,

 Scenario: Replaced items should be returned to stock
   Given that a customer buys a blue garment
     and I have two blue garments in stock
     and three black garments in stock.
    When he returns the garment for a replacement in black,
    then I should have three blue garments in stock
     and two black garments in stock.

Each scenario is an example, designed to illustrate a specific aspect of behavior of the application.

When discussing the scenarios, participants question whether the outcomes
described always result from those events occurring in the given context.
This can `help to uncover further scenarios which clarify the
requirements`__. For instance, a domain expert noticing that refunded items
are not always returned to stock might reword the requirements as "Refunded
or replaced items should be returned to stock, unless faulty.".

This in turn helps participants to pin down the scope of requirements,
which leads to better estimates of how long those requirements will take to
implement.

The words "Given", "When" and "Then" are often used to help drive out the
scenarios, but are not mandatory.

These scenarios can also be automated, if an appropriate tool exists to
allow automation at the UI level. If no such tool exists then it may be
possible to automate at the next level in, i.e.: if an MVC design pattern
has been used, the level of the Controller.


Programmer-domain examples and behavior
---------------------------------------

The same principles of examples, using contexts, events and outcomes are
used to drive development at the level of abstraction of the programmer, as
opposed to the business level. For instance, the following examples
describe different aspects of the list's behavior:

.. code-block:: gherkin

 Scenario: New lists are empty
   Given a new list
    then the list should be empty.

 Scenario: Lists with things in them are not empty.
   Given a new list
    when we add an object
    then the list should not be empty.

Both these examples are required to describe the boolean nature of a list
in Python and to derive the benefit of the nature. These examples are
usually automated using TDD frameworks. In BDD these examples are often
encapsulated in a single method, with the name of the method being a
complete description of the behavior. Both examples are required for the
code to be valuable, and encapsulating them in this way makes it easy to
question, remove or change the behavior.

For instance as unit tests, the above examples might become:

.. code-block:: python

 class TestList(object):
    def test_empty_list_is_false(self):
        list = []
        assertEqual(bool(list), False)

    def test_populated_list_is_true(self):
        list = []
        list.append('item')
        assertEqual(bool(list), True)

.. Other practitioners[who?], particularly in the Ruby community, prefer to split these into two separate examples, based on separate contexts for when the list is empty or has items in. This technique is based on Dave Astels' practice, "One assertion per test"[12].
.. 12. https://techblog.daveastels.com/tag/bdd/

Sometimes the difference between the context, events and outcomes is made more explicit. For instance:

.. code-block:: python

 class TestWindow(object):
    def test_window_close(self):
        # Given
        window = gui.Window("My Window")
        frame = gui.Frame(window)

        # When
        window.close()

        # Then
        assert_(not frame.isVisible())

However the example is phrased, the effect describes the behavior of the
code in question. For instance, from the examples above one can derive:

- lists should know when they are empty
- window.close() should cause contents to stop being visible

The description is intended to be useful if the test fails, and to provide
documentation of the code's behavior. Once the examples have been written
they are then run and the code implemented to make them work in the same
way as TDD. The examples then become part of the suite of regression tests.


Using mocks
-----------

BDD proponents claim that the use of "should" and "ensureThat" in BDD
examples encourages developers to question whether the responsibilities
they're assigning to their classes are appropriate, or whether they can be
delegated or moved to another class entirely. Practitioners use an object
which is simpler than the collaborating code, and provides the same
interface but more predictable behavior. This is injected into the code
which needs it, and examples of that code's behavior are written using this
object instead of the production version.

These objects can either be created by hand, or created using a
mocking framework such as :pypi:`mock`.

Questioning responsibilities in this way, and using mocks to fulfill the
required roles of collaborating classes, encourages the use of Role-based
Interfaces. It also helps to keep the classes small and loosely coupled.
