=====================
Feature Testing Setup
=====================

.. if you change any headings in here make sure you haven't broken the
   cross-references in the API documentation or module docstrings!

Feature Testing Layout
======================

*behave* works with three types of files:

1. `feature files`_ written by your Business Analyst / Sponsor / whoever
   with your behaviour scenarios in it, and
2. a "steps" directory with `Python step implementations`_ for the
   scenarios.
3. optionally some `environmental controls`_ (code to run before and after
   steps, scenarios, features or the whole shooting match).

.. _`feature files`: #gherkin-feature-testing-language
.. _`Python step implementations`: tutorial.html#python-step-implementations
.. _`environmental controls`: tutorial.html#environmental-controls

These files are typically stored in a firectory called "features". The
minimum requirement for a features directory is::

  features/
  features/everything.feature
  features/steps/
  features/steps/steps.py

A more complex directory might look like::

  features/
  features/signup.feature
  features/login.feature
  features/account_details.feature
  features/environment.py
  features/steps/
  features/steps/website.py
  features/steps/utils.py


Layout Variations
-----------------

*behave* has some flexibility built in. It will actually try quite hard to
find feature specifications. When launched you may pass on the command
line:

**nothing**
  In the absence of any information *behave* will attempt to load your
  features from a subdirectory called "features" in the directory you launched
  *behave*.

**a features directory path**
  This is the path to a features directory laid out as described above. It may be called
  anything by *must* contain at least one "*name*.feature" file and a directory
  called "steps". The "environment.py" file, if present, must be in the same
  directory that contains the "steps" directory (not *in* the "steps"
  directory).

**the path to a "*name*.feature" file**
  This tells *behave* where to find the feature file. To find the steps
  directory *behave* will look in the directory containing the feature
  file. If it is not present, *behave* will look in the parent directory,
  and then its parent, and so on until it hits the root of the filesystem.
  The "environment.py" file, if present, must be in the same directory
  that contains the "steps" directory (not *in* the "steps" directory).

**a directory containing your feature files**
  Similar to the approach above, you're identifying the directory where your
  "*name*.feature" files are, and if the "steps" directory is not in the
  same place then *behave* will search for it just like above. This allows
  you to have a layout like::

   tests/
   tests/environment.py
   tests/features/signup.feature
   tests/features/login.feature
   tests/features/account_details.feature
   tests/steps/
   tests/steps/website.py
   tests/steps/utils.py

If you're having trouble setting things up and want to see what *behave* is
doing in attempting to find your features use the "-v" (verbose)
command-line switch.


Gherkin: Feature Testing Language
=================================

*behave* `features`_ are written using a language called `Gherkin`_ (with
with `some modifications`_) and are named "*name*.feature".

.. _`some modifications`: #modifications-to-the-gherkin-standard

These files should be written using natural language - ideally by the
non-technical business participants in the software project. Feature files
serve two purposes – documentation and automated tests.

It is very flexible but has a few simple rules that writers need to adhere to.

Line endings terminate statements (eg, steps). Either spaces or tabs may be
used for indentation (but spaces are more portable). Indentation is almost
always ignored - it's a tool for the feature writer to express some
structure in the text. Most lines start with a keyword ("Feature",
"Scenario", "Given", ...)

Comment lines are allowed anywhere in the file. They begin with zero or
more spaces, followed by a sharp sign (#) and some amount of text.

.. _`gherkin`: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin


Features
--------

Features are composed of scenarios. They may optionally have a description,
a background and a set of tags. In its simplest form a feature looks like:

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Feature: feature name

    Scenario: some scenario
        Given some condition
         Then some result is expected.

In all its glory it could look like:

.. code-block:: gherkin

  @tags @tag
  Feature: feature name
    description
    further description

    Background: some requirement of this test
      Given some setup condition
        And some other setup action

    Scenario: some scenario
        Given some condition
         When some action is taken
         Then some result is expected.

    Scenario: some other scenario
        Given some other condition
         When some action is taken
         Then some other result is expected.

    Scenario: ...

The feature name should just be some reasonably descriptive title for the
feature being tested, like "the message posting interface". The following
description is optional and serves to clarify any potential confusion or
scope issue in the feature name. The description is for the benefit of
humans reading the feature text.

.. any other advice we could include here?

The Background and Scenarios will be discussed in the following sections.


Backgrounds
-----------

A background consists of a series of steps similar to `scenarios`_.
It allows you to add some context to the scenarios of a feature.
A background is executed before each scenario of this feature but after any
of the before hooks. It is useful for performing setup operations like:

  * logging into a web browser or
  * setting up a database

with test data used by the scenarios.

The background description is for the benefit of humans reading the feature text.
Again the background name should just be a reasonably descriptive title
for the background operation being performed or requirement being met.


It contains `steps`_ as described below.

**Good practices for using Background**

Don’t use "Background" to set up complicated state unless that state is actually something the client needs to know.
 For example, if the user and site names don’t matter to the client, you
 should use a high-level step such as "Given that I am logged in as a site
 owner".

Keep your "Background" section short.
 You’re expecting the user to actually remember this stuff when reading
 your scenarios. If the background is more than 4 lines long, can you move
 some of the irrelevant details into high-level steps? See `calling steps
 from other steps`_.

Make your "Background" section vivid.
 You should use colorful names and try to tell a story, because the human
 brain can keep track of stories much better than it can keep track of
 names like "User A", "User B", "Site 1", and so on.

Keep your scenarios short, and don’t have too many.
 If the background section has scrolled off the screen, you should think
 about using higher-level steps, or splitting the features file in two.

.. _`calling steps from other steps`: api.html#calling-steps-from-other-steps
.. _`Cucumber Background description`: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Background


Scenarios
---------

Scenarios describe the discrete behaviours being tested. They are given a
title which should be a reasonably descriptive title for the scenario being
tested. The scenario description is for the benefit of humans reading the
feature text.

Scenarios are composed of a series of `steps`_ as described below. The
steps typically take the form of "given some condition" "then we expect
some test will pass." In this simplest form, a scenario might be:

.. code-block:: gherkin

 Scenario: we have some stock when we open the store
   Given that the store has just opened
    then we should have items for sale.

There may be additional conditions imposed on the scenario, and these would
take the form of "when" steps following the initial "given" condition. If
necessary, additional "and" or "but" steps may also follow the "given",
"when" and "then" steps if more needs to be tested. A more complex example
of a scenario might be:

.. code-block:: gherkin

 Scenario: Replaced items should be returned to stock
   Given that a customer buys a blue garment
     and I have two blue garments in stock
     but I have no red garments in stock
     and three black garments in stock.
    When he returns the garment for a replacement in black,
    then I should have three blue garments in stock
     and no red garments in stock,
     and two black garments in stock.

It is good practise to have a scenario test only one behaviour or desired
outcome.

Scenarios contain `steps`_ as described below.


Scenario Outlines
-----------------

These may be used when you have a set of expected conditions and outcomes
to go along with your scenario `steps`_.

An outline includes keywords in the step definitons which are filled in
using values from example tables. You may have a number of example tables
in each scenario outline.

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Scenario Outline: Blenders
     Given I put <thing> in a blender,
      when I swtich the blender on
      then it should trasform into <other thing>

   Examples: Amphibians
     | thing         | other thing |
     | Red Tree Frog | mush        |

   Examples: Consumer Electronics
     | thing         | other thing |
     | iPhone        | toxic waste |
     | Galaxy Nexus  | toxic waste |

*behave* will run the scenario once for each (non-heading) line appearing
in the example data tables.

The values to replace are determined using the name appearing in the angle
brackets "<*name*>" which must match a headings of the example tables. The
name may include almost any character, though not the close angle bracket
">".

Substitution may also occur in `step data`_ if the "<*name*>" texts appear
within the step data text or table cells.


Steps
-----

Steps take a line each and begin with a *keyword* - one of "given", "when",
"then", "and" or "but".

In a formal sense the keywords are all Title Case, though some languages
allow all-lowercase keywords where that makes sense.

Steps should not need to contain significant degree of detail about the
mechanics of testing; that is, instead of:

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Given a browser client is used to load the URL "http://website.example/website/home.html"

the step could instead simply say:

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Given we are looking at the home page

Steps are implemented using Python code which is implemented in the "steps"
directory in Python modules (files with Python code which are named
"*name*.py".) The naming of the Python modules does not matter. *All* modules
in the "steps" directory will be imported by *behave* at startup to
discover the step implementations.

Given, When, Then (And, But)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*behave* doesn't technically distinguish between the various kinds of steps.
However, we strongly recommend that you do! These words have been carefully
selected for their purpose, and you should know what the purpose is to get
into the BDD mindset.

Given
"""""

The purpose of givens is to **put the system in a known state** before the
user (or external system) starts interacting with the system (in the When
steps). Avoid talking about user interaction in givens.  If you had worked
with usecases, you would call this preconditions.

Examples:

- Create records (model instances) / set up the database state.
- It's ok to call directly into your application model here.
- Log in a user (An exception to the no-interaction recommendation. Things
  that "happened earlier" are ok).

You might also use Given with a multiline table argument to set up database
records instead of fixtures hard-coded in steps. This way you can read
the scenario and make sense out of it without having to look elsewhere (at
the fixtures).

When
""""

Each of these steps should **describe the key action** the user (or
external system) performs. This is the interaction with your system which
should (or perhaps should not) cause some state to change.

Examples:

- Interact with a web page (`Requests`_/`Twill`_/`Selenium`_ *interaction*
  etc   should mostly go into When steps).
- Interact with some other user interface element.
- Developing a library? Kicking off some kind of action that has an
  observable effect somewhere else.

.. _`requests`: http://python-requests.org/
.. _`twill`: http://twill.idyll.org/
.. _`selenium`: http://seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/

Then
""""

Here we **observe outcomes**. The observations should be related to the
business value/benefit in your feature description. The observations should
also be on some kind of *output* - that is something that comes *out* of
the system (report, user interface, message) and not something that is
deeply buried inside it (that has no business value).

Examples:

- Verify that something related to the Given+When is (or is not) in the output
- Check that some external system has received the expected message (was an
  email with specific content sent?)

While it might be tempting to implement Then steps to just look in the
database - resist the temptation. You should only verify outcome that is
observable for the user (or external system) and databases usually are not.

And, But
""""""""

If you have several givens, whens or thens you could write:

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Scenario: Multiple Givens
    Given one thing
    Given an other thing
    Given yet an other thing
     When I open my eyes
     Then I see something
     Then I don't see something else

Or you can make it read more fluently by writing:

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Scenario: Multiple Givens
    Given one thing
      And an other thing
      And yet an other thing
     When I open my eyes
     Then I see something
      But I don't see something else

The two scenarios are identical to *bevave* - steps beginning with "and" or
"but" are exactly the same kind of steps as all the others. They simply
mimic the step that preceeds them.


Step Data
~~~~~~~~~

Steps may have some text or a table of data attached to them.

Substitution of scenario outline values will be done in step data text or
table data if the "<*name*>" texts appear within the step data text or
table cells.


Text
""""

Any text block following a step wrapped in ``"""`` lines will be associated
with the step.  This is the one case where indentation is actually parsed:
the leading whitespace is stripped from the text, and successive lines of
the text should have at least the same amount of whitespace as the first
line.

So for this rather contrived example:

.. code-block:: gherkin

   Scenario: some scenario
     Given a sample text loaded into the frobulator
        """
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
        eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
        enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
        nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
        reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat
        nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident,
        sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
        """
    When we activate the frobulator
    Then we will find it similar to English

The text is available to the Python step code as the ".text" attribute
in the :class:`~behave.runner.Context` variable passed into each step
function. The text supplied on the first step in a scenario will be
available on the context variable for the duration of that scenario. Any
further text present on a subsequent step will overwrite previously-set
text.


Table
"""""

You may associate a table of data with a step by simply entering it,
indented, following the step. This can be useful for loading specific
required data into a model.

The table formatting doesn't have to be stricltly lined up but it does need
to have the same number of columns on each line. A column is anything
appearing between two vertical bars "|". Any whitespace between the column
content and the vertical bar is removed.

.. code-block:: gherkin

   Scenario: some scenario
     Given a set of specific users
        | name      | department  |
        | Barry     | Beer Cans   |
        | Pudey     | Silly Walks |
        | Two-Lumps | Silly Walks | 
 
    When we count the number of people in each department
    Then we will find two people in "Silly Walks"
     But we will find one person in "Beer Cans"

The table is available to the Python step code as the ".table" attribute
in the :class:`~behave.runner.Context` variable passed into each step
function. The table is an instance of :class:`~behave.model.Table` and
for the example above could be accessed like so:

.. code-block:: python

  @given('a set of specific users')
  def impl(context):
      for row in context.table:
          model.add_user(name=row['name'], department=row['department'])

There's a variety of ways to access the table data - see the
:class:`~behave.model.Table` API documentation for the full details.


Tags
----

You may also "tag" parts of your feature file. At the simplest level this
allows *behave* to selectively check parts of your feature set.

You may tag features, scenarios or scenario outlines but nothing else.
Any tag that exists in a feature will be inherited by its scenarios and
scenario outlines.

Tags appear on the line preceding the feature or scenario you wish to tag.
You may have many space-separated tags on a single line.

A tag takes the form of the at symbol "@" followed by a word (which may
include underscores "_"). Valid tag lines include:

   @slow
   @wip
   @needs_database @slow

For example:

.. code-block:: gherkin

   @wip @slow
   Feature: annual reporting
     Some description of a slow reporting system.

Tags may be used to `control your test run`_ by only including certain
features or scenarios based on tag selection. The tag information may also
be accessed from the `Python code backing up the tests`_.

.. _`control your test run`: #controlling-your-test-run-with-tags
.. _`Python code backing up the tests`: #accessing-tag-information-in-python


Controlling Your Test Run With Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a feature file with:

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Feature: Fight or flight
    In order to increase the ninja survival rate,
    As a ninja commander
    I want my ninjas to decide whether to take on an 
    opponent based on their skill levels

    @slow
    Scenario: Weaker opponent
      Given the ninja has a third level black-belt 
      When attacked by a samurai
      Then the ninja should engage the opponent

    Scenario: Stronger opponent
      Given the ninja has a third level black-belt 
      When attacked by Chuck Norris
      Then the ninja should run for his life
      
then running ``behave --tags=slow`` will run just the scenarios tagged
``@slow``. If you wish to check everything *except* the slow ones then you
may run ``behave --tags=-slow``.

Another common use-case is to tag a scenario you're working on with
``@wip`` and then ``behave --tags=wip`` to just test that one case.

Tag selection on the command-line may be combined:

**--tags=wip,slow**
   This will select all the cases tagged *either* "wip" or "slow".

**--tags=wip --tags=slow**
   This will select all the cases tagged *both* "wip" and "slow".

If a feature or scenario is tagged and then skipped because of a
command-line control then the *before_* and *after_* environment functions
will not be called for that feature or scenario.


Accessing Tag Information In Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tags attached to a feature and scenario are available in
the environment functions via the "feature" or "scenario" object passed to
them. On those objects there is an attribute called "tags" which is a list
of the tag names attached, in the order they're found in the features file.

There are also `environmental controls`_ specific to tags, so in the above
example *behave* will attempt to invoke an ``environment.py`` function
``before_tag`` and ``after_tag`` before and after the Scenario tagged
``@slow``, passing in the name "slow". If multiple tags are present then
the functions will be called multiple times with each tag in the order
they're defined in the feature file.

Re-visiting the example from above; if only some of the features required a
browser and web server then you could tag them ``@browser``:

.. code-block:: python

  def before_feature(context, feature):
      model.init(environment='test')
      if 'browser' in feature.tags:
          context.server = simple_server.WSGIServer(('', 8000))
          context.server.set_app(web_app.main(environment='test'))
          context.thread = threading.Thread(target=context.server.serve_forever)
          context.thread.start()
          context.browser = webdriver.Chrome()

  def after_feature(context, feature):
      if 'browser' in feature.tags:
          context.server.shutdown()
          context.thread.join()
          context.browser.quit()


Languages Other Than English
----------------------------

English is the default language used in parsing feature files. If you wish
to use a different language you should check to see whether it is
available::

   behave --lang-list

This command lists all the supported languages. If yours is present then
you have two options:

1. add a line to the top of the feature files like (for French):

    # language: fr

2. use the command-line switch ``--lang``::

    behave --lang=fr

The feature file keywords will now use the French translations. To see what
the language equivalents recognised by *behave* are, use::

   behave --lang-help fr


Modifications to the Gherkin Standard
-------------------------------------

*behave* can parse standard Gherkin files and extends Gherkin to allow
lowercase step keywords because these can sometimes allow more readable
feature specifications.
