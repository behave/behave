Feature: Issue #290: Call before/after_background_hooks when running backgrounds

  Provide environment hooks before_background and after_background to
  allow eg. caching of complicated backgrounds

  Background:
    Given a new working directory
    And a file named "features/steps/steps.py" with:
        """
