Feature: Issue #162 Unnecessary ContextMaskWarnings when assert fails or exception is raised

  | Behave shows unnecessary ContextMaskWarnings related to:
  |
  |   * tags
  |   * capture_stdout
  |   * capture_stderr
  |   * log_capture
  |
  | if:
  |
  |   * an assertion fails in a step-definition/step-function
  |   * an exception is raised by a step-definition/step-function
  |
  | and an additional scenario follows.
  | REASON: Context "behave" mode is not restored when an exception is raised.
