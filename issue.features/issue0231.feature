Feature: Issue #231: Display the output of the last print command

  . The output of the last print command in a step is not displayed
  . in the behave output (at least with standard pretty formatter),
  . unless the string to print ends with newline ('\n').
  .
  . ANALYSIS: NOT-REPRODUCIBLE
  .   Checked print function and stdout without newline.
  .   Both show the expected capture stdout output when the step fails.

  Scenario: Write to stdout without newline
    When I run "behave -f pretty --no-color -T features/syndrome1.feature"
