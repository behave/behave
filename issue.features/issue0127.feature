Feature: Issue #127: Strip trailing colons

  | Trailing colon in a step is stripped by the Gherkin parser.
  | Undefined step snippets should not suggest the step with a trailing colon.
  |
  | GENERAL RULE (by looking at the parser):
  |   1. Colon in step in feature file is OK
  |      (parser strips this for step-with-table or step-with-multiline-text).
  |   2. Step definitions in Python files should not end with a colon
  |      (used in @given/@when/@then decorators).


  Background:
    Given a new working directory
    And   a file named "features/example127.feature" with:
