Feature: Issue #385 -- before_scenario called too late

    . RATIONALE:
    . Due to:
    .
    .   * skip scenario/feature support in before_scenario (and before_feature) hooks
    .   * active-tags
    .
    . formatters are now called to early (for before feature/scenario functionality).
    . Formatters should be called after the before-hooks are processed.
    .
    . DECISION PENDING TO REVERT OR NOT: In behave v1.2.7
    .  * Capturing hooks requires that the Formatter is called
    .    before the "before_feature/before_scenario" hook is called.
    .
    . NOTES:
    .  * Test uses show_skipped=false to ensure that at least the
    .    scenario/feature title is shown with plain formatter.
