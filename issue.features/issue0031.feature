Feature: Issue #31 "behave --format help" raises an error

  Scenario:
    Given a new working directory
    When I run "behave --format=help"
    Then it should pass
    And the command output should contain:
      """
      Available formatters:
      json: JSON dump of test run
      json-pretty: JSON dump of test run (human readable)
      null: Provides formatter that does not output anything.
      plain: Very basic formatter with maximum compatibility
      pretty: Standard colourised pretty formatter
      """
