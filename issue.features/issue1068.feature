Feature: Issue #1068 -- Feature.status is Status.failed in before_scenario() Hook

  . DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVED BEHAVIOR:
  .  Current feature status computation makes only sense after all scenarios are executed.
  .  Each scenario.status is initially in "Status.untested" before the test run.
  .  If a hook implementation decides to call "context.abort()" during the test run,
  .  several scenarios of a feature may still be untested.
  .
  .  Therefore, the feature status computation currently counts
  .  an untested scenario as failed if one or more scenarios have passed or failed.

  Background: Setup
    Given a new working directory
    And a file named "features/steps/use_step_library.py" with:

    When I run "behave -f plain features/syndrome_1068_1.feature"

      1 feature passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
      3 scenarios passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped

    And the command output should contain:
      """
      BEFORE_SCENARIO: Feature status is: Status.untested (scenario: Test case 1.1)

    And the command output should contain:

    And the command output should contain:

    But note that "the feature.status is failed iff some scenarios are passed and others untested"
