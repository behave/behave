Feature: Issue #1158 -- ParseMatcher failing on steps with type annotations

  . DESCRIPTION OF SYNDROME (OBSERVED BEHAVIOR):
  .  * AmbiguousStep exception occurs when using the ParseMatcher
  .  * MISTAKEN: No such problem exists
  .  * PROBABLY: Error on the user side

  Scenario: Check Syndrome
