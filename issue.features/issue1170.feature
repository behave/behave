Feature: Issue #1170 -- Tag Expression Auto Detection Problem

  . DESCRIPTION OF SYNDROME (OBSERVED BEHAVIOR):
  . TagExpression v2 wildcard matching does not work if one dashed-tag is used.
  .
  . WORKAROUND-UNTIL-FIXED:
  . * Use TagExpression auto-detection in v2 mode (or strict mode)


  Background: Setup
