Feature: Issue #1180 -- Negative Time Problem with Summary Reporter

  . DESCRIPTION OF SYNDROME (OBSERVED BEHAVIOR):
  .   When I use "freezegun.freeze_time()" in one of my steps
  .   Then the summary report may show negative duration for the test-run duration.
  .
  . ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM (and solution):
  .   Freezegun must be configured to ignore one/some behave module(s).
  .
